Depending on whether PC-3 is kept or removed from the motility data:

In raw_tracking_data_motility:
- re-run .py scripts without PC-3

In I_substrate_sensitivity:
- modify motility.Rdata files by removing PC-3 row
- main_plots.R and supplementary_plots.R: Keep or remove the parts marked by !!!. Then re-run the scripts

In II_comparison_bw_cell_lines:
- cell_line_specific_median_and_density.R: Keep or remove the parts marked by !!!. Then re-run the scripts
- correlation_analysis: rerun if PC-3 is removed
- signif_test_for_medians_cancer_vs_noncancer.R: rerun if PC-3 is removed
- box_plots_tissue_specific.R: rerun if PC-3 is removed

In III_clustering:
- PCA.R: rerun if PC-3 is removed
- wasserstein1/compute_<>.R: reurn if PC-3 is removed
- kolmogrov-smirnov/comput_<>.R: rerun if PC-3 is removed
